The Screaming Debugger Visual Studio Extension 
Unleash the ultimate debugging experience with the Screaming Debugger, a unique and quirky Visual Studio extension designed to bring a sense of humor to your development process. This innovative tool not only makes your debugging easier, but it also makes it more amusing and entertaining.

As developers, we dread unhandled exceptions. These bugs can be difficult to spot and can take time to solve, especially in a large codebase. However, with the Screaming Debugger extension, every unhandled exception in your Visual Studio 2022 projects will be announced with a distinct screaming sound! Yes, you heard it right - your IDE will literally scream at you, instantly alerting you whenever your code runs into an unhandled exception.

This innovative auditory cue is an effective way to draw your attention immediately to the problem, particularly during long coding sessions or when you're multitasking. This screaming notifier is not just functional but also brings a touch of levity to the often stressful task of debugging.

The Screaming Debugger doesn't stop there, users can configure the path to the .wav file through Visual Studio's Options dialog (Tools > Options > Screaming Debugger > General).

If you're looking for a fun, novel, and effective way to manage unhandled exceptions in your code, then the Screaming Debugger is the Visual Studio extension you need. Get ready for a screamingly good debugging experience!
